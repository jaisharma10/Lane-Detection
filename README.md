# Advanced Lane Detection

The goal of the project is to build a lane detection pipeline for a ground vehicle. This project was done as part of an assignment for  the following course - ENPM673, Perception for Autonomous Robots.

The two python files perform the following tasks:
- Problem2.py - detect and distinguish dashed lanes from solid lanes
- Problem3.py - predict curvature of the road in front
